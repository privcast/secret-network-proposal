## Description



## Secret Network Integration Description

Users can store their squads securely using FHE by Secret Network. Provided the low gas fees in Secret Network, all changes can be directly sponsored by Luffy creating a super clean UX where users can ensure permissionless privacy and data ownership with the same web2 like user experience. UX is not holding back web3 anymore. We have AA enabled walllets with social auth and passkeys for a seamless gaming experience. 

## Go-to-Market plan



## Value capture for Secret Network ecosystem

This product will serve as a great addition to the gaming products in the Secret Network ecosystem. The fantasy sports market is massive with the market size of $30.95B and monthly active user base of 2.2B where 1.2B are users of age 16-24. It has a compound annual growth rate of 13.8% and the market is expected to be $87.07B by 2031. Privacy in fantasy sports market is crucial and I believe Secret Network will play a pivotal role for this case.
