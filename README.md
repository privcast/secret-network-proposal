Private Polling Application in Farcaster Frames powered by Secret Network

## Problem

Currently there is no solution to create private polls in farcaster. Private polls are necessary to create an environment where the users can vote and voice their opinions without revealing their identity. Privacy preserved polls are crucial in creating a social media platform of the new internet where the data privacy and data ownership is of utmost importance. There is a need for a permissionless and transparent system with a UX that is similar to the existing solutions so that users don't have friction in using this new solution. 

## Solution

Private polls is facilitated by Trusted Execution Environments, by computing the private states in Secret Smart contracts. Users will vote on polls by encypting their votes using their encryption keys. Our application will be built using Next.js framework. We will be using Frames.js/Base on chain kit to build our frames and request transactions directly from the frame. We will use secret.js that relays transactions along with the voter signature using the developer wallet.  

## Description

PrivCast will have an EVM smart contract and Secret Smart contract. Everything from creating, voting and viewing results happens within the farcaster frame. Users can choose to create a frame either from the website or directly from the frame. Poll creators can choose an option to reveal the results during the voting period or reveal it once the poll ends. This provides more customization for the creators to set their poll to view realtime results or after reveal them after the poll ends. Poll creators or anyone can fund the gas to enable gasless voting for the polls. 

## Go-to-Market plan

* Creating short form content and tutorials describing the process of creating a frame, voting on them and viewing results.
* Will post the product in https://github.com/a16z/awesome-farcaster for more reach.
* Talks about the product in meetups and conferences.
* Will post blogs in Medium about the imporatance of privacy and private polling applications.

## Value capture for Secret Network ecosystem

This will be one of the very first Secret applications built on Farcaster Frames. I think it will serve as an example for users to built more farcaster frames using Secret Network. After shipping this product successfully, I want to work on building a SDK for users to be able to build applications that can send secret tranasctions directly from the frame without redirecting to a new page.

## Team's experience

I have been building web3 applications for 3+ years. Having won 33+ hackathons, I have good experience building scalable applications from scratch. In the past 2 years, I have worked at BlitzCraftHQ and RPSLabs which is backed by OrangeDAO and Chainlink.

## Development Roadmap

I don't need any more developers. I have already hired video editor/content creator/ui designer for $200/month to handle marketing, social media and outreach.

Ideally, we can receive payments in 2 disbursements, one at the beginning of the grant, one after the completion of the product described in the description.

## Additional Information

This project was the finalist of the ETHGlobal Circuit Breaker 2024 Hackathon. We built it using zero knowledge proofs but we wanted to build a solution which is fast and cheaper both computation wise and execution time wise. Secret Network was the best implementation that we could come up with after our research.
