## Description

Transparency and data privacy concerns are widespread in the sports betting industry, affecting user trust and competition integrity. Platforms like Fantasy Premier League concentrate user squads, making them exposed to breaches and untrustworthy approaches. Such breaches can lead to the unauthorized disclosure of personal data or retroactive changes to team makeup, changing competitive dynamics and harming the confidence of users.

The solution depends on offering users increased transparency and data privacy protections. We hope to develop a sports betting environment that restores confidence, protects user privacy, and promotes integrity through the use of web3 technology and zero-knowledge proofs. This approach will allow all participants to place bets on sports with confidence, knowing that their data is safe and the competition is fair.

Luffy is the only privacy preserved fantasy football solution in the market. Users can create squads and store them securely using Secret Network only submitting the hash of the squad on-chain. Users can place their bets on any EVM chain of their choice. Once the gameweek ends, we use chainlink to fetch player performance data from reliable sport APIs and compute the points of the players using our very own custom algorithm. Once the player points are posted on-chain, users can then fetch their squads from Secret Network by verifying their signature. Now the user can generate a zero knowledge proof and verify it on-chain to declare the points won without revealing their squad! Now they can claim the rewards based on the points that they earned. We have our cross-chain infrastructure setup using Hyperlane. This entire infrastructure is public, permissionless and automated.

## Secret Network Integration Description

Users can store their squads securely using FHE by Secret Network. Provided the low gas fees in Secret Network, all changes can be directly sponsored by Luffy creating a super clean UX where users can ensure permissionless privacy and data ownership with the same web2 like user experience. UX is not holding back web3 anymore. We have AA enabled walllets with social auth and passkeys for a seamless gaming experience. 

## Go-to-Market plan

## Value capture for Secret Network ecosystem

This product will serve as a great addition to the gaming products in the Secret Network ecosystem. The fantasy sports market is massive with the market size of $30.95B and monthly active user base of 2.2B where 1.2B are users of age 16-24. It has a compound annual growth rate of 13.8% and the market is expected to be $87.07B by 2031. Privacy in fantasy sports market is crucial and I believe Secret Network will play a pivotal role for this case.

I need 1 experienced frontend developer to build the UI. Having good knowledge with the technicalities, I can build the backend myself. I have already hired video editor/content creator/ui designer for $200/month to handle marketing, social media and outreach.

Ideally, we can receive payments in 2 disbursements, one at the beginning of the grant, one after the beta launch at the end of Q2.

## Additional Information

The main vision is to build this project and ship it as soon as possible to apply for the Alliance DAO accelerator Cohort 13. We have our MVP ready and we need to take this product to the next stage and to the market hopefully by the end of the year. Currently we have partnerships with Aztec. Pushing for more protocols that we use in our product.
